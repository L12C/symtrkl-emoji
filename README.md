# Sym's emoji mods

I butcher emoji. Like, a lot. Now I'm bothering to actually save them in one place.

Importable archives of each category can be found [in this release](https://github.com/SymTrkl/emoji/releases/tag/importable), the files are updated when I add new ones. Other [releases](https://github.com/SymTrkl/emoji/releases) have importable archives for various individual updates.

*(The high res versions of the older ones no longer exist, so that directory is very incomplete.)*
